# drt-vio-initialization
## Decoupled Rotation and Translation VIO initialization
An accurate and robust initialization is crucial for visual inertial odometry (VIO). Existing loosely-coupled VIO initialization methods suffer from poor stability from structure-from-motion (SfM). Whereas tightly-copupled methods often ignore the gyroscope bias in the closed-form solution, resulting in limited accuracy. Moreover, the aforementioned two classes of methods are computationally expensive, because 3D point clouds need to be reconstructed simultaneously. We propose a novel VIO initialization method, which decouples rotation and translation estimation, and achieves higher efficiency and better robustness. This code is the implementation of our proposed method, which runs on **Linux**. We also provide the code of loosely coupled method and tightly coupled method for comparision as described in the paper. Since I am still busy cleaning up the code,  we released  the drt-vio-initialization and other comparison algorithms will be released later.

## 1. Prerequisites
1.1 **Ubuntu** 
* Ubuntu 16.04 or Ubuntu 18.04

1.2. **Dependency**

* C++14 or C++17 Compiler
* Eigen 3.3.7
* OpenCV 3.4.9
* Boost 1.58.0
* Cere-solver 1.14.0: [Ceres Installation](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html), remember to **sudo make install**.

## 2. Build Project with Cmake
Clone the repository and compile the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/boxuLibrary/drt-vio-init.git
cd ~/drt-vio-init/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

## 3.Performance on EuRoC dataset


#### 3.1 Download [EuRoC MAV Dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets). Although it contains stereo cameras, we only use one camera and IMU data.

#### 3.2 You can run different initialization method on the dataset via configuration parameter. The methods for comparision include:
* Open-VINS initialization (preparing)
* VINS-Mono initialization (preparing)
* An improved work of ORB-SLAM3 initializaiton (preparing)
* Our method in a tightly coupled manner (Released)
* Our method in a loosely coupled manner (Released)

#### 3.3 You can run the code with:

```
./executableFile codeType dataType
```
where codeType means the initialization method. You can set to be drtTightly or drtLoosely. And dataType means the name of save file, that is consistent with the running dataset.
